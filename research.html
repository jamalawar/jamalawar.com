      <h2>Current PhD Work</h2>
      <p>My PhD in Film by Practice explores the thematic connections between Lebanon’s post‑civil‑war film industry and the conflict itself, as well as the industry’s financial ties to foreign countries. Through archival research, interviews and creative practice, I am investigating how foreign funding shapes narratives and how filmmakers grapple with memory, trauma and the politics of representation.</p>
      <p>The research culminates in a feature‑length mockumentary, <strong>Waiting for Gouraud</strong>, which will critique the Lebanese film industry’s obsession with civil‑war stories while staging a meta‑film about a chaotic film set. This project employs satire and absurdity as critical tools.</p>

      <h2>Talks & Teaching</h2>
      <p>I regularly deliver talks and workshops on Lebanese cinema, postcolonial theory and creative practice. Previous engagements include guest lectures at the American University of Beirut, where I taught courses such as “Poetry and Motion” and “Fiction Writing for Video Games,” as well as workshops for the Middle East Media Initiative (USC School of Cinematic Arts) and the London Screenwriters’ Festival.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for upcoming presentations and publications.</p>
