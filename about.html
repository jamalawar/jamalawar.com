          <p>Jamal Awar is a Lebanese filmmaker, actor and researcher based in London. Born and raised in Beirut, he began acting at a young age and later moved behind the camera to tell stories that interrogate the relationship between Lebanon’s cinema, its civil war and foreign funding. His work spans fiction, documentary and music videos.</p>
          <p>Jamal directed the award‑winning short film <strong>Art of Waiting</strong> (2020) and the documentary <strong>Ma Mada</strong> (2018). As part of his ongoing PhD in Film by Practice at the University for the Creative Arts, he is developing <strong>Waiting for Gouraud</strong>, a satirical mockumentary that critiques Lebanon’s film industry through a chaotic film‑within‑a‑film.</p>
          <p>Jamal’s practice also includes music videos for Lebanese rapper El Rass—such as “Bilal,” “Vodka w Cerelac,” “Jullanar,” “Fernas,” “Kheffash” and more—which have garnered festival awards. In addition to his creative projects, he produces corporate videos and collaborates with organisations including the English Football Association (ITV/Google Pixel), Burst Productions and Avara fintech.</p>
